# My Homebrew Rules v1.3 (modified Feb 18, 2022)

## Magic Item creation 

https://dicecove.com/crafting-magic-items/, read this first for a quick explanation if you dont have Xanathars.


### Harvesting

I will be doing a spin on the Xanathar ruleset for magic item creation. My first stipulation on magic item creation on how components are harvested. Survival checks are needed to harvest components from monsters. The following table provides the information on the cost of  making a magic items in days, gp and monster CR component. The last column shows the DC for harvesting the component from the given CR range.


| Rarity    | Workweeks | Cost       | Monster CR Range | Survival Check DC for harvest |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| common    | 1         | 50 GP      | 1-3              | 10                            |
| uncommon  | 2         | 200 GP     | 4-8              | 15                            |
| rare      | 10        | 2,000 GP   | 9-12             | 20                            |
| very rare | 25        | 20,000 GP  | 13-18            | 25                            |
| legendary | 50        | 100,000 GP | 19+              | 30                            |

- Reasoning for adding the Survival check DC is to counter not needing to homebrew recipes for each magic item, rather any part of a powerful creature could work instead.
- Magic Items classified as artifacts cannot be crafted however.
- Cannot modify existing magic items (i.e. cannot convert +1 sword to +2 sword)
- Harvesting will give you a "magic item component" of varying degrees (i.e. uncommon magic component), RP what ever the part is but track its rarity.
- A single monster can only be harvested once.
- Every failed harvest attempt brings up the DC difficultly up by 3 for repeated attempts. (i.e. if you fail the first harvest of DC 10, the next attempt will have a DC of 13, and 16 for the next)

#### *Optional Class Feature for Ranger:*
>- You have advantage on harvest checks (survival) on creatures targeted by your Favored Enemy / Favored Foe.


#### *Feat: Monster Hunter* 
>You have honed the skills needed to hunt monstrosities.
>- +1 to Wisdom
>- You learn the Hunter's Mark spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you cannot cast this spell this way until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
>- Gain proficiency in Survival. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.

### Crafting 

My Second stipulation on magic item creation, is that you need a particular tool proficiency to create an item of a particular type. You will also need the specified tool in hand to create magic items.

| Type                       | Needed Tool Proficiency                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Staff, wand, poles, rods   | wood carver's tools, carpenter's tools                   |
| armor, weapons             | smith's tools                                            |
| clothing                   | leather worker's tools, weaver's tools, cobbler's tools  |
| jewelry, amulets, tablets  | jeweler's tools, glassblower's tools, mason's tools      |
| potions                    | alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils |
| scrolls                    | calligrapher's supplies                                  |
| everything else            | tinker's tools                                           |


#### Hiring Assistance

Using the rules in the PHB for services (page 159), you can hire a skilled worker to craft items that you would like for 2 GP per day. To add to this, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to craft an item by the number of workers partaking in the project. For example, an item which takes 10 days to craft by 1 person will take 5 days by 2 people. 

#### *Feat: Magic Item Master* 

>prerequisite: level 12
>
>You have mastered the crafting of magic items. You have identified where inefficiencies are in the process, and know how to address them.
>- +1 Intelligence
>- Gain 1 tool proficiency.
>- If you craft a magic item of ANY rarity, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold. (Stacks with Magic Item adept, however stacks for only common and uncommon items).

### Other Feats I thought would be cool

#### *Feat: Niv-Mizzet's Dragon Mark*
>prerequisite: level 10, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature.
>
>You are blessed (or cursed) with the mark of Niv-Mizzet. Some of his magic prowess now reside in you.
>- +1 Con 
>- You can now concentrate on 2 different spells at the same time. If you fail a concentration check, you lose concentration on both spells. 
>- You must spend hit die equal to the half the combined spell level of both spells (rounded up) plus 1 to activate this feature. Hit die spent this way are recovered every long rest. If you do not have the available amount of hit die required, you cannot use this feature.
>- You permanently loses one of your hit die, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to a roll of that die plus your Constitution modifier. (minimum is 1). This reduction can't be reversed by any means.


#### *Feat: Infuser Adept*
>prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, and a tool proficiency.
>
>Studying various magical constructs, you have learned to craft an artificer infusion: you learn one Infusion option of your choice from the artificer class. If the infusion has a prerequisite, you can choose that infusion only if youâ€™re an artificer and only if you meet the prerequisite. If the infusion has staged level development (i.e. enhanced weapon), you can choose that infusion only if you're an artificer and meet any prerequisites. You can create this infusion following the Artificer's rules for "Infusing an Item".
>
>Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the infusion with another one from the Artificer class.
